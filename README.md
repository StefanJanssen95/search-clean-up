# search-clean-up
Browser extension to remove search results from certain websites

Tested on:
- MS Edge 78.0.276.2 (Chromium), should also work on other Chromium based browsers
- Firefox 68.0.2

Currently the only way to use the extension is by downloading the source and use it as a developer.

## Chrome

## Other Chromium based browsers
Not tested yet, using the explanation of installing on MS Edge and Opera might help you in the right direction
